# react-extensions

## A React Component Library

### Installation

Ensure you have [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) installed.

To add Cosmos to your React application, run:

```
$ yarn add react-extensions
```

If you prefer npm, run this command instead:

```
$ npm install --save react-extensions
```

That's all you need to do: no config changes required!
